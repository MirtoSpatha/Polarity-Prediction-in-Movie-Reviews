# Supervised-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, we used a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews to predict the sentiment linked with each review (positive or negative). 
The dataset creation was based on a 5-star rating that the reviewers gave. 

The methods used to predict the sentiment were Bayesian Classification, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and an LSTM Deep Neural Network. All the methods had an accuracy above 80%.

The project followed a notebook style and was created in a Google Collab Environment.
