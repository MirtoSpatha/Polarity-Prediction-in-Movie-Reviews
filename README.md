# Positive and Negative Sentiment Prediction in Movie Reviews

In this project, we used a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews to predict the sentiment linked with each review (positive or negative). 
The dataset creation was based on a 5-star rating that the reviewers gave. 

We used Supervised Machine Learning Methods because they obtain promising results in Classification problems and help the new engineers understand the basic principles of Machine Learning. We also created our project in a notebook style to improve readability and we developed it in the Google Collab Environment to avoid memory issues and to help both collaborators update the project in the same notebook.

The methods used to predict the sentiment were Bayesian Classification, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and an LSTM Deep Neural Network. All the methods had an accuracy above 80%.

This project was written in Python and in collaboration with Thibaut Le Marre ( https://github.com/thibaut-lm ).

Below, you can see how we structured our project and what were the main parts of our work:
1. Preprocessing
2. Data Understanding
3. Naive Bayes Model
4. Logistic Regression Model
5. Support Vector Machine Model
6. Depp Learning Model
7. Results Comparison
8. Future Work
